            "Have you ever talk to someone and you come to think 'Ah, this guy reminds me of that John Doe that I knew'? I have. several times. And most of the times, I found out later that they have same blood type. Or when I watch somebody and realize that we have some things in common and I sort of understand him/her. Later turns out we have same blood type. I have bumped into this kind of situations many times that I started to have this question: Is blood type personality a real thing?",
            "This blood type personality thing is not so popular in my country. I think most people here just have barely heard of it. Meanwhile in Japan, people choose their partner or even employees based on their blood type.",
            "As I googled this online, I found out that this blood type personality theory is not scientifically proven. Some scientist corelate this issue to self-fulfilling prophecy; that Japanese people changed their personality to fit their blood type. Some people even compare this to zodiac signs. ",
            "I personally don't believe in zodiac. I mean, how does the position of the stars have anything to do with human behavior? Blood type personality definitely makes much more sense to me. You carry out your gene in your blood and it streams everywhere inside your body. It's reasonable to think that, maybe, blood type does affect our personalites. It's not that everyone with same blood type will have exactly same characters. They might have some basic things in common, but they could be different in one way or another.",
            "So you say 'So what? we don't put people into boxes based on their blood type'. You're right. We don't put people into boxes. But to me, it's sort of useful that I can guess how other people think or feel, how they would react to some certain things, or if we can trust them or not, like 'Oh, I have experience with this kind of person before so I can use those experiences to handle this person now'. It's like being able to read people's mind without special training. Not bad, huh?"

            "I spent my teenage years reading self-help-motivational-psychological books and I truly enjoyed it. I was totally into pshycology, well, maybe I still am. I found it incredible that we can explain human behaviour, or sort of read people's mind, and change them. At some point I started to use those 'pshycological knowledge' of mine to understand myself better. I'd like to know myself, and more than anything, like any other teenager, I had some kind of urge to define  and state What Kind of Person I Am. I would take several kinds of personality test like Myersâ€“Briggs, DISC, even some random quiz on facebook. At that time, trying to define and understand my inner self was kinda fun. Doesn't it feel good to have some words describing your characters, especially the nice ones?.",
            "What those tests told me? Well that's not really important, because, first, I barely remember the results of the tests, and second, that -what those tests said about me- doesn't really matter anymore. As time goes by and life started to hit me pretty hard, my well defined characters from my teenage years started to change. ",
            "As i got my first full time job after graduated college, I somehow got astonished by how fake people could be and how naive I have been. I got overwhelmed with these one unfamiliar thing: Office Politics. But I was a small girl with huge pride; 'I won't lose to these fake people with no moral sense!' Well, I was too judgemental at that time. please forgive me. Anyways, I decided to stay and struggle. In order to fight and win, I need to adapt to the environment, right?. I changed the way I dress, the way I speak, I learned to intimidate and persuade people, I learn bad things from bad people. It really didn't bring out the best in me, but I survived. The thing is, few years later I found myself as a totally different person. I was getting closer to become the kind of person I used to hate. That's when I took a break and think back; 'Was this what I want? Turning into a cruel evil girl just to win the game?'. I didn't think so. ",
            "So I stopped intimidating people, I stopped faking compliments, I pushed aside those fake people I used to befriend with. I wanted to struggle beautifully. I tried to gain respect, not fear. I'd compliment people when they deserve it, not when I need their help. I tried to care for others more genuinely. I lost some friends, but I don't have a reason to keep fake friends around. Have I regret any of those changes? Well, I'm still feeling sorry for everyone i've ever mistreated. But I don't regret that I've been bad and hateful. I might never be what I am today if I've never been what I was yesterday.",
            "That, my friend, is what happened to me and my personality. I constantly change because I constantly learn new things. I can never guarantee what kind of person I will be in the following years. A grumpy lady, maybe?. I hope not.",
            "Now after passing mid-twenties, I don't even have time to care what I am anymore. Those INTP-ENTJ whatsoever doesn't mean anything anymore to me. Because I am more than what those tests can describe. My life has made me unique and complicated and I am thankful for that. I started to listen and pay more attention to people around and that amazingly helped me learn about myself more. When life hits me hard, I'd struggle and stand for myself, tell myself I deserve the dreams I've always dreamt. When people bring me down, I'd love myself more, thank myself more, tell myself: having flaws is not a sin. My flaws are part of me as much as my strengths are. Those flaws, in fact, made me human, made me Me. So don't ask me what kind of person I am. I don't have time to explain, because I am too busy loving myself and improving myself."
